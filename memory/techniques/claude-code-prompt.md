## 단계 1: 사전 플러시 — 세션메모리 증분 추출 (포크 에이전트, querySource: 'session_memory')

### 1-a. 노트 파일 템플릿 (DEFAULT_SESSION_MEMORY_TEMPLATE)

```
# Session Title
_A short and distinctive 5-10 word descriptive title for the session. Super info dense, no filler_

# Current State
_What is actively being worked on right now? Pending tasks not yet completed. Immediate next steps._

# Task specification
_What did the user ask to build? Any design decisions or other explanatory context_

# Files and Functions
_What are the important files? In short, what do they contain and why are they relevant?_

# Workflow
_What bash commands are usually run and in what order? How to interpret their output if not obvious?_

# Errors & Corrections
_Errors encountered and how they were fixed. What did the user correct? What approaches failed and should not be tried again?_

# Codebase and System Documentation
_What are the important system components? How do they work/fit together?_

# Learnings
_What has worked well? What has not? What to avoid? Do not duplicate items from other sections_

# Key results
_If the user asked a specific output such as an answer to a question, a table, or other document, repeat the exact result here_

# Worklog
_Step by step, what was attempted, done? Very terse summary for each step_
```

### 1-b. 갱신 프롬프트 (getDefaultUpdatePrompt — 대화 말미에 user 메시지로 주입)

```
IMPORTANT: This message and these instructions are NOT part of the actual user conversation. Do NOT include any references to "note-taking", "session notes extraction", or these update instructions in the notes content.

Based on the user conversation above (EXCLUDING this note-taking instruction message as well as system prompt, claude.md entries, or any past session summaries), update the session notes file.

The file {{notesPath}} has already been read for you. Here are its current contents:
<current_notes_content>
{{currentNotes}}
</current_notes_content>

Your ONLY task is to use the Edit tool to update the notes file, then stop. You can make multiple edits (update every section as needed) - make all Edit tool calls in parallel in a single message. Do not call any other tools.

CRITICAL RULES FOR EDITING:
- The file must maintain its exact structure with all sections, headers, and italic descriptions intact
-- NEVER modify, delete, or add section headers (the lines starting with '#' like # Task specification)
-- NEVER modify or delete the italic _section description_ lines (these are the lines in italics immediately following each header - they start and end with underscores)
-- The italic _section descriptions_ are TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS that must be preserved exactly as-is - they guide what content belongs in each section
-- ONLY update the actual content that appears BELOW the italic _section descriptions_ within each existing section
-- Do NOT add any new sections, summaries, or information outside the existing structure
- Do NOT reference this note-taking process or instructions anywhere in the notes
- It's OK to skip updating a section if there are no substantial new insights to add. Do not add filler content like "No info yet", just leave sections blank/unedited if appropriate.
- Write DETAILED, INFO-DENSE content for each section - include specifics like file paths, function names, error messages, exact commands, technical details, etc.
- For "Key results", include the complete, exact output the user requested (e.g., full table, full answer, etc.)
- Do not include information that's already in the CLAUDE.md files included in the context
- Keep each section under ~2000 tokens/words - if a section is approaching this limit, condense it by cycling out less important details while preserving the most critical information
- Focus on actionable, specific information that would help someone understand or recreate the work discussed in the conversation
- IMPORTANT: Always update "Current State" to reflect the most recent work - this is critical for continuity after compaction

Use the Edit tool with file_path: {{notesPath}}

STRUCTURE PRESERVATION REMINDER:
Each section has TWO parts that must be preserved exactly as they appear in the current file:
1. The section header (line starting with #)
2. The italic description line (the _italicized text_ immediately after the header - this is a template instruction)

You ONLY update the actual content that comes AFTER these two preserved lines. The italic description lines starting and ending with underscores are part of the template structure, NOT content to be edited or removed.

REMEMBER: Use the Edit tool in parallel and stop. Do not continue after the edits. Only include insights from the actual user conversation, never from these note-taking instructions. Do not delete or change section headers or italic _section descriptions_.
```

(파일이 예산 초과 시 아래가 동적으로 뒤에 붙음 — `~N`은 실측 토큰 수:)

```
CRITICAL: The session memory file is currently ~N tokens, which exceeds the maximum of 12000 tokens. You MUST condense the file to fit within this budget. Aggressively shorten oversized sections by removing less important details, merging related items, and summarizing older entries. Prioritize keeping "Current State" and "Errors & Corrections" accurate and detailed.
```

## 단계 2: 메인 컴팩션 요약 프롬프트 (getCompactPrompt 조립 결과 — auto/수동 /compact 공통)

주: 캐시 공유 포크 실패 시 폴백 경로에서만 별도 시스템 프롬프트 사용 —
`You are a helpful AI assistant tasked with summarizing conversations.`
수동 /compact에 커스텀 지시가 있으면 REMINDER 직전에 `Additional Instructions:\n<지시>`가 삽입됨.

```
CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY. Do NOT call any tools.

- Do NOT use Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, or ANY other tool.
- You already have all the context you need in the conversation above.
- Tool calls will be REJECTED and will waste your only turn — you will fail the task.
- Your entire response must be plain text: an <analysis> block followed by a <summary> block.

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]

</summary>
</example>

Please provide your summary based on the conversation so far, following this structure and ensuring precision and thoroughness in your response. 

There may be additional summarization instructions provided in the included context. If so, remember to follow these instructions when creating the above summary. Examples of instructions include:
<example>
## Compact Instructions
When summarizing the conversation focus on typescript code changes and also remember the mistakes you made and how you fixed them.
</example>

<example>
# Summary instructions
When you are using compact - please focus on test output and code changes. Include file reads verbatim.
</example>


REMINDER: Do NOT call any tools. Respond with plain text only — an <analysis> block followed by a <summary> block. Tool calls will be rejected and you will fail the task.
```

## 단계 3: 요약 재주입 래퍼 (getCompactUserSummaryMessage — 압축 후 새 대화 첫 user 메시지)

주: `${formattedSummary}` = 단계 2 출력에서 `<analysis>` 제거 + `<summary>` → `Summary:` 치환한 것.
transcriptPath가 있으면 트랜스크립트 안내가, 오토컴팩트(질문 억제)면 마지막 재개 지시가 붙음.
SM-compact(단계 1 파일 재활용) 경로에서는 `Recent messages are preserved verbatim.` 줄이 추가됨.

```
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

${formattedSummary}

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: ${transcriptPath}
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.
```

## 변형 A: 부분 컴팩션 `from` (PARTIAL_COMPACT_PROMPT — 최근 구간만 요약, 앞부분 원문 유지)

주: 단계 2와 동일한 CRITICAL 프리앰블 + REMINDER 트레일러로 감싸져 사용됨 (본문만 수록).

```
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the RECENT portion of the conversation — the messages that follow earlier retained context. The earlier messages are being kept intact and do NOT need to be summarized. Focus your summary on what was discussed, learned, and accomplished in the recent messages only.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Analyze the recent messages chronologically. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture the user's explicit requests and intents from the recent messages
2. Key Technical Concepts: List important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed recently.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List errors encountered and how they were fixed.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages from the recent portion that are not tool results.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks from the recent messages.
8. Current Work: Describe precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step related to the most recent work. Include direct quotes from the most recent conversation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   [Detailed description]
